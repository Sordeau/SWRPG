Hi and welcome to my Python App!

To use it, you will need to download Python. Right click and run the file with python.
It will prompt you to enter how many of each type of die to run.
The simulation is run 100K times for each roll.
If you want to see the code, I recommend Sublime Text 3 as an editor and then open the file using that.
